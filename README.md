opencl-hello-world
==================

This is my Hello World application for OpenCL, using the LWJGL framework to handle the native calls.  It is actually more of a "Hello Solar System" as it does a few things.  First, it polls all platforms and devices and lists basic stats about your system.  Second, it performs a vector addition.  The kernel is loaded from a resource file, rather than the usual hard-coding you see in many examples.  This project uses Gradle.  See the README for instructions on how to run this.
